## âš¡ Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Installation process (Python version mismatch)
- **Issue:** Odoo 17 required Python **3.12.8**, but my system initially had a different version installed.  
- **Solution:** Installed Python 3.12.8 and configured the environment. Once the correct version was set up, the module installation worked without issues.
  
### 2. Virtual environment confusion
- **Issue:** I created a virtual environment (`venv`) but accidentally tried to run Odoo with the global Python environment instead. This caused dependency conflicts and errors.  
- **Solution:** Activated the correct virtual environment before starting Odoo, ensuring that the dependencies installed in the venv were used. Example:  
  ```bash
  # On Linux/macOS
  source venv/bin/activate

  # On Windows
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
### 3. Menus not appearing
- **Issue:** Menus defined in XML did not display.  
- **Solution:** Correctly linked the root menu, then updated the module using `-u student_management`.

### 4. Module not visible in Apps list
- **Issue:** Module did not show up under Apps.  
- **Solution:** Removed the default *Apps filter* and ensured `__manifest__.py` included `"application": True`.
